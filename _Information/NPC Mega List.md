Archaeologist(rare desert bazaar)-middle

Wizard Hostage(wiz towers)-top


Monk(mountains)
	- Namaste, outsider. Take a seat and free your mind with us. 
	- Nice try. If I do not get insulted, the anger falls back on you. 
	- Meditating comes with practice, your mind will wander. But what matters is you always come back to a singular focus. In time, anyone can achieve emotional mastery. 
	- Find the peace in even the toughest challenges in life. 

Witch doctor (swamp)
	- *sniff* *sniff* Why hello there, my pretties! Take a look around, and *cough* don’t eat any apples you find lying around here. 
	- Oh dear, I seem to have lost my ring in the oven! Could you take a peek inside?
	- Why, its hard to imagine I was a young pretty thing once. I got *cough* old and sickly from the *hack* unsanitary working environments in a swampland brewery, working with frogs legs and monkey heads. But I won’t stop, Ive traveled too far and too wide to stop now. I must craft the Intoxication Potion…
	- Have a *HACK HICKnice day! And say, if you were ever to get your hands on any potions that make your skin crawl, could you bring em back here?


Elder (badlands)
	- Welcome to my humble town, young traveler. 
	- I thought you were cunning, like the ferocious fox, prowling for prey. But now I see you’re oblivious, like a bunny rabbit, about to be eaten. 
	- Why, I got this position by surviving for as long as I did. Its not an easy world for villagers, here. Some are crammed into poor working conditions, forced into labor and more. I hope to change that. 
	- May you be in good spirits. 

Great Huntsman (Jungle)
	- Tally Ho, young buck! What can I get done for yah?
	- Now hold on, that takes guts to stand up to me. Marksman arent to be tried. 
	- Me and the White Death have a lot in common.. But hes too patient. I go in swinging from vine to vine, howling and acting on primal instinct. He just… sits there. Waiting. Which is why its crazy that he has more kills than me. 
	-  ‘Ave a g’day there mate!

White Death (Snow) (guard villager with bow)
	-  …
	-  … (do you know who I am.)
	-  … (Cold… so.. Cold…)
	-  …

Fur Trapper (Spruce)
	- Hello. I have rare furs. Give me money. 
	- I trap, you pay. That is how this works. 
	- Stupid people think being trapper is easy. It is not. Must be patient. Must be precise. 
	- I go now. 

Good Illager (Dark Oak)
	- Hrnnnnngh. (Please don’t be afraid, I just want to trade.)
	- Heh humh. (I once turned bad, and am reverting back to good, but I am reconsidering that stance.)
	- Huh hernm (I want people to understand that villagers become illagers for a variety of reasons. You become an illager when you turn violent not in self defense. Some of us are just fed up with society…)
	- Her hern! (Have a sparkling day!)

Sailor Captain (Ocean harbor)
	- Ahoy me boy, I’ve overeaten on fish tail and I may be faintin’, argargargargarg. 
	- Come on, mate, you might as well cut off me other leg if you’re going to pull it so hard. 
	- I always wanted me a lassy and a boyo of me own. But me job won’t have it, with me doing the busy work fixin’ up a whole crew.  Sigh, I guess we chose to sail  the tough seas though, right? Life of a sailor.
	- Have a scurvy-free day, eh? And don’t choose a life at sea. Theres more work to be done here than the janitor in Davey Jones’ locker room. 

False Knight (plains) (nitwit in armor)
	- Tools, Ammo, Gear, you want it? Its yours my friend, as long as you have enough emeralds. 
	- Why, you scoundrel? Do you think youre better than me, a great knight?
	- I remember a time when I met a bug who was a knight. He bore a strange mask and was mute. He taught me that anyone can become a great knight, even if they’re hollow on the inside. 
	- May your conquests be swift. 

Traveling Merchant (desert) (wandering trader’s brother)

	- Greetings, my three camels have wares, if you have coin. What would you like today?
	- You remind me of my brother. He’s always getting himself into situations where he could be killed. (When not trade)
	- Hows the weather in the cold biomes? I wish I was there sometimes. It’s hot as hell in this stuffy little room i’m in. 
	- I wish you safe travels in these arid lands.

EverKeeper(spawns in white palace and shaded citadel, sells diff things)
	- I am what remains. 
	- *curses you in an ancient tongue*
	- I am the Everkeeper, the original ancestor of all the Gatekeepers. I gave the beasts of this realm the ability to evolve, as long as they don’t put the balance of Bright and Dawn at risk. Unfortunately, some weren’t as true to their word as others, and over time, I was forced into hiding when those beasts became too powerful, causing an imbalance here. Thank you for freeing this realm.
	- (Everbright) The brightness no longer knows bounds, and the stars shine blindingly once again. Yin is restored. 
	- (Everdawn) The darkness is all consuming, and the vacuum of the void fights with the earth once more. Yang is restored. 
	- Now go, bring balance to all the realms. And don’t forget: trust noone. 

Everbright
Miner(Everbright)
	- I got lights, potions, food, everything needed for all your mining expeditions. Though the village seriously needs to invest in some better equipment..
	- Well that’s not very nice. Im here to help ya. Go ahead without me, though, the caves will take care of yeh like squashing a bug.  
	- The Astronomers all say that the future is in the stars, bright and above us. I try to stay down to earth.  
	- Block and stone, you beautiful Miner!

Bruiser(Everbright)
	- Velcome. I have fist, you have sword, we make good team. 
	- I kick you like little baby if you try that again. 
	- I used to be world champion. I would wrestle Azulfo and feed whole village for month. I could take 3 illagers at once. But then big blizzard hit. Now I must take care of hometown, so I move fruit and livestock for a living. 
	- All vill fear you now!   

Plague Doctor(Everdawn)
	- Hern hrm hernn. What do we have here..
	- Now now, I may have cured all sorts of diseases here, but I also have venoms that could kill an elephant 13 times over. Want to try that again?
	- I use only the most effective methods to cure patients, from leeches for poison-spider bites, cutting knives for arrow wounds, and this new invention I like to call a hacksaw for heart injuries.. (*overheard whispers*though the healing is not as rewarding as the hurting..)
	- Don’t forget to keep all your organs inside you!

Highwayman(Everdawn)
	- Stick your hands up! Oh, sorry, I thought you were someone else. 
	- Make like a egg and scramble before you get folded like an omelette partner
	- Ever since she took the kids, ive had to turn to crime to get by. I don’t know whats worse, the men that want my head, or the fact that sometimes I just want to give it to em. 
	- Don’t be like me, kid. 

Piglin Ancestor(ghost)(village)
	- Who’s there? Mom, is that you?
	- I am a vengeful spirit, kept alive by sheer malice. Do you really think it’s a good idea to test my patience?
	- I was separated from my mother in the Great Bastion Siege; a coordinated attack that left many piglin strongholds a ruin of their former selves. The last thing I remember is being crushed under rubble. And now I have been trapped here, unable to let go out of sheer rage ever since, at the one who did this: Ignis, the God of Hellfire. Please, you must best him and his armies to avenge my people. 
	- (Post Ignis) I have been waiting for this moment my entire (un)life. I cannot believe the carnage is finally over. Please, take this as a gift of my undying gratitude. However, I still have not been able to leave this world. I guess the real reason I was trapped here was to reunite with my mother, which I probably never will. But I’m ok with that. At least I got to meet someone like you. 
	- Go, and enjoy your freedom!
	
Piglin Merchant(piglin village)
	- Oink oink reeeauh. (Give me gold)
	- Grumble grumble. (This is why I wanted to be a warrior.)
	- Honk honk.(I have things. Now give me gold.)

Warthoglin(castle)
	- ROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRR. (Hi :D )
	- ROAR ROAR. (Its ok :DDD)
	- GGGGRRRROOOOOOAAAAAAAARRRRRRNNNNNNNNMMGGGGHHHH. *loud exhale through nose*. (Please excuse my warts, I shower ever day, I am not stinky :D)
	- GRUNT. (Byyyyyeeee hehe :3 )

Pigman(bastion) 
	- Whats up, buddy! Long time no see,  I bet you thought I was a goner, huh? God, I remember when you were so much younger. How time has passed, huh?
	- Hey, I thought you liked me?
	- And then I said, “whats the pig idea? Im just porkin around, don’t go all hogwild on me!! Haha” and then he turned around and shot me 
	- Blood for the blood god!

Arthropod King(top of infested temple)
	- Grand entrance, I see. 
	- I am the arthropod king. I have been here for centuries. I’ve seen empires fall, people I respect lost to… all sorts of things. 
	- I have been waiting in this temple for reasons I cannot explain to you. 
	- Hiss off. 

Wither Reaper(stronghold portal)
	- Do not let it out
	- It must not come out
	- There is no turning back
	- All withers away… 
	- (Post ws) All comes to an end…

Ancient Blacksmith(foundry) - Insanely old illager relegated to guard the foundry from him, formerly helped defeat Entity
	-  …How did you find me?
	- I have to be here… must… protect
	- I have forged greater things than your wildest imaginations. 
	- *somehow, you are reading his memory* I…  I ‘m  s o r r y,  E n d e r . . .  Y o u  w e r e  m y  b e s t f r I e n d. . .  I  d i d n ‘t  m e a n  t o  g i v e  y o u  u p  t o  t h e m . . .  I  j u s t  w a n t e d  y o u  t o  b e  s a f e . . .


Netherrealm Keeper(fortress) extremely old piglin
	- I am the Netherrealm Keeper. I watch over the Nether for Ancient Threats. 
	- Are you hostile?- No. I am too mature to care if you are wearing gold. Yet I have the ability to see hostility where others see none. It is how I saved my realm; by preparing it for the betrayal to come. I now use it to help the spirits here atone.
	-  Where are we?- The Nether. It is the realm below the Overworld; it's shadow cast wide and far. Home to Wither and Undying, it is where the soul goes to rectify. As to where the other realms are, I had a keeper friend I havent seen in a while who might know...
	- The Netherrealm is chaos incarnate. But it is not all that I am watching for. 

Greybot(1000 years old, witnessed the war) forge ruins
	- *BEEEEP* TURNING ON… SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL. 
	- I AM GREYBOT A SENTIENT ROBOT. I WAS CREATED TO PROTECT [REDACTED]
	- I HAVE NOT BEEN OPERATIONAL IN *pause* approximately one thousand years
	- I DO NOT NEED A BATTERY. I AM CREATED BY THE [REDACTED] AND THE [REDACTED]. THEY ARE THE GREATEST MECHANICS IN HISTORY. 
	- I HAVE SEEN A GREAT WAR. A WAR *pause* approximately one thousand years *pause* AGO. MANY CAME TOGETHER TO SEAL [REDACTED]. THEY CAME TO STOP THE ENTITY… (description of entry has been deleted) 

The Great Tinkerer(tinker house)(old villager)
	- Haha, hey bro wassup?
	- Who am I? Haha, I’m just your friendly neighborhood tinkerer! I don’t have any secrets… oh you found the trapdoor to the basement? Haha, yeah that’s what I was talking about
	- Me and my old buddy, uh, this blacksmith guy, used to be yin and yang. Mining and crafting. Heh. Last I saw of him was at this meeting we had, where we had to share our work. Felt just like yesterday. Guess some people just drift apart. 
	- Wanna see something cool? *puts wrench in nose and screws a cog with it*
	- I need to get out more often. I mean, it’s my life, y’know? I just wish I didn’t have so much work to be doing. And so much to make up for. 


Deepling Giant(In the Sunken City) - Former demigod, helped defeat endersoul
	- I am the Deepling Giant. I am a thousand- year old demigod made of pure Abyss, and I have been assigned here to fulfill duties I cannot inform you of. I also do not engage in small talk. 
	- Aren't you lonely here?- I do not answer stupid questions, either. I'm not emotional like you humans, I don't do small talk, and certainly not loneliness. I have a responsibility more serious than you could ever imagine; if I slip up, then I have failed all those before me.
	- Why can't you tell me?- I am the last of a remaining few alive who know. The last time we told someone they tried to stop us... and one cataclysm was enough already. It's too risky to tell an outsider like you, who reeks of ill intent.


Lost Ghost(desert temple) -enderman In desert pyramid, formerly powerful, lost its name, helped stop the endersoul, lost memory
	-  …I didn’t make it…
	-  …I’m sorry, people that I don’t remember, I failed, when I had the power…
	-  … I am Enderman? Yes, yes I am…
	-  … I wish I could teleport out of this…

The Last Ogre(sorrow dungeon) old goblin
	- I am here out of obligation. I would be making a terrible mistake to tell you what that is. 
	- I miss my donkey. 
	- I... am the last ogre. It never fails to hurt to say that. Goblins are my only living relatives, for we are like neanderthals to humans. Extinct.
	- The sorrow dungeon is home to many horrors. But they aren't my main concern; I could fend them off with ease if I wanted to. No, I'm preparing for something much bigger. The sorrow dungeon has living magic; I'm looking for some of my own. 

Ender communicator (appears in visions)
	- Trade options dialogue
	- Dialogue1
	- D2
	- D3
	- D4

Tillager(windmill) - At the top
	- Heh. What do you want. 
	- I can do farming all day.
	- You may have beaten my friends, but its their fault since they were weak. No harm no foul. 
	- Feel free to help yourself to the wheat in front of the windmill. I have plenty to spare. 
	- I got hoes for days. 

Geckologer(keep kayra)- studying in gecko library
	- Hey, I have some cool books if ya want em. 
	- These libraries are incredible. Also thank you for taking out the locals, now I can read in peace. 
	- Wow, I cant believe these guys took down a whole Mutant Creeper using only their tongues!
	- Slimes seem to be an effective mount in combat for these people. They also tend to eat them after the fact. 
	- I really want to know what was in the Library of Geckandria before it burned down. 


Diceologer(dame fortuna) - Spawns in nearest village post boss
	- Why hello there, oh blocky one. Dice to meet you. 
	- Step right up! Take a roll of the dice for the chance to win big!
	- Yknow, people always say life is unfair or that bad people should get their karma. I say that Lady Luck doesn’t make mistakes. 
	- The fortune! The fame! Isnt it all so enticing?
	- I miss my brother d20. He was shattered with a hammer after giving a 1 to a pivotal moment in a dnd game. You could say he die-d. 


Arms Dealer (random bandit tower room) -Surrenders upon defeat if kept alive
	- Im stayin neutral in the illager conflict. Buy my goods if yer up for stayin alive in this wild world. 
	- Those illagers didn’t know what hit em. You drew quicker than any bandit I done seen in the west.  
	- I play both sides so I always come out on top. 
	- Seen some type of touristy bandit village near the towers sometimes. People come from all over for the gambling, so that brings attention to the locals. 
	- Keep that hat tilted upwards and that big iron on yer hip, even when the coast seems clear. The badlands aint no joke; Kangaroos’ll kick the wind outta ye, bandits’ll ride in guns blazin, and vultures’ll pick at yer corpse when yer down. Not to mention the most ferocious lil goons of them all: emus. 

Piglin Chef in Disguise(as illager) (illager fort purple house) spawns at the top - If you don’t kill will be friendly when freed
	- W-why hello, don’t mind me I’m just a f-friendly illager chef, I’m unarmed
	- W-We have all sorts of food f-for only the bravest of us illagers haha, like steak, chicken, calamari- NOT bacon though, p-please don’t ask for bacon
	- Haha, im t-totally not thankful you freed- I mean kidnapped me, from those l-lovely illagers or anything
	- Whats that? Why do I s-stutter? Well, it certainly i-is not because I w-was forced into servitude, haha that’s silly, I loved being a chef for my f-friends
	- *oink* oh, haha I didn’t see you there haha, I just have a weird sounding cough

Illager Prince(fort) - 
Spawns in castle, king fled, is harmless and incompetent
	- Eugh, What do you want. And why arent you bowing down to me.  
	- My dad, the king by the way, fled because hes a coward and didn’t wanna defend his castle if he thought hed lose. Im taking your side because at least you didn’t back down.
	- Why didn’t China warn us about incoming invaders, theyre 24 hours ahead of us?? Rude. 
	- Royal responsibilities are so annoying. I just want to be rich for doing nothing, but people want me to “enact laws” and “stop stealing our wealth”.  Like just work harder, don’t bring me into your mess.

Illager conman(post raid) -neutral, tries to disguise as villager
	- Hey kid, don’t mind my grey skin, im a villager lawyer, I just have a skin pigment disorder. Wanna trade?
	- My brother is a lawyer, and I always wanted to be like him. But because he thinks im some conniving mastermind, and too immature, he says I cant be a real lawyer. Ill show him. 
	- I got an evoker to shoot lightning bolts through his fingertips once. Made him seem like a god in Illager clothing. 
	- My client pleads oopsie daisie, your honor. 
	- Don’t think about my prices too much. Trust me, youre getting a steal. 

Alchemist(Everdawn) post boss
	- Hrnnm. It seems you’ve bested me. I guess 

Summoner (everbright) post boss

Pack Leader(ape)(jungle treehouse) - middle 
	- Ooh ooh. (Hello. I protect tribe. You give us banana, we protect you too.)
	- Ooh ee. (The world has many monkeys. Chimpanzees are chill. Gerados are loud and ugly. Orangutan, I slap Orangutan on sight. )
	- Ee ooh aa (Feel free to leave human world and join ape tribe anytime. Reject human. Return to monkey.) 
	- Oo e aa aa aah. (We hang out in treehouse when humans aren’t there. We used to be invited until we rode their train to get there off a cliff.)
	- Aa. (🎶
	[Intro]
	He-he-here we go!
	
	So they're finally here, performing for you
	If you know the words, you can join in too
	Put your hands together, if you want to clap
	As we take you through this monkey rap!
	Huh!	
	[Chorus]
	DK
	Donkey Kong!)

Mooshroom Princess (In mushroom house) - top
	- Your princess is in another castle, I swea- oh, you’re not a captor, phew. 
	- Heh, it’s a rough life as a princess. Ive been being kidnapped for as long as I can remember. Even tried to romanticize my captor once to let me go and all that did was make them want to kidnap me even more. Luckily i’m always miraculously saved. 
	- I like doing things for myself for once. I would have my Sporeling subjects make me breakfast every morning; fresh mycelium on toast with mungus spore juice. The Mooshroom bandits would bring me feasts to make me fall in love with them. But I think I like cooking for myself better. 
	- People think I’m either a strong, independent Mooshroom leader, or a helpless damsel in distress, when really, I never wanted to be either in the first place. I just wanted to be normal. Being born a princess isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I guess. 
	- I remember when a person tried to milk me once. At the time I didn’t know he was trying to get mushroom stew. I learned a lot about myself that day. 

Calamarie (glow squid) (ruins of deep) - trapped in ice
	- Well hello there darling, what can I get for you?
	- My, my, you’re positively glowing! You don’t have a bad bone in your body. 
	- I love a man who can change his colors for any given situation. 
	- The other squids always pulled my tentacles in class and called me stuck up; those same guys now peck the ground I slide on..
	- Is that ink in your pants, or are you just happy to see me?

Exotilotl(axolotl)(ocean monument)
	- WHY HELLO THERE! YOU LOOK FUNNY! NOT LIKE ANY FISH IVE EVER SEEN!
	- THE OTHER AXOLOTLS MADE FUN OF ME, SO I HYPNOTIZED THEM WITH MY PSYCHEDELIC SCALES! AND MADE THEM KISS THEIR BUTTS! 
	- PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT AXOLOTLS FOR THEIR RARE COLORS, BUT WHEN THEY SEE ME ALL OF A SUDDEN IM “TOO COLORFUL” AND “NEED TO STOP TRYING TO EAT THEM”! SO RUDE!
	- HEY WANNA SEE ME DO THIS! *dislocates limbs to twist his body and puts his head between his legs* THIS DOESN’T HURT AT ALL!
	- THE GUARDIANS IN THE MONUMENT DON’T MIND ME BEING THERE AT ALL! IN FACT WERE BEST FRIENDS! THEY MAY TRY TO LASER ME FROM TIME TO TIME BUT I CAN REFLECT IT! ONE TIME I REFLECTED THE BEAM BACK AT ONE AND HE STOPPED MOVING! HE’S SO SILLY

Owlette(owl) (woodland mansion)
	- Hoot-hoot (Hello, i’m supposed to be an evokers pet, but I just scratch them whenever they try to capture me and stick around to torment them. Also, I have extensive knowledge of all the illager’s darkest magic. Ask away)
	- Hoot (I was raised by woodpeckers, so I could peck away at the mansion walls, they didn’t like that haha)
	- Hooty hoot hoot (Do you have any rabbits? No particular reason)
	- Hooty (I used to put pellets on the illagers pillows, they tried to curse me out but I would grab their wand from them haha)
	- Hoot hoo (I always wanted a Mister Owl of my own but Im always rejected because I’m too nice. All owls are the same *shakes head 360 degrees*) 

Mythical creatures can only be contacted if you know their language. 

Wyvern (sunbird of the end)(aviary) - middle/random room

Decrepid Sphinx(labyrinth treasure room)

Aether Angel(blight dungeon)-
	- *mystical harp music plays*
SkullWalker(House Horrors)-
	- *the sins of your past come crawling up your spine*
Spectre of Pure Void(Heavenly x)
	- *dazzling gleam*

Furlin (in cage in ancient mines)
	- Hey you! Need a hug?
	- The best things in life are furry. 
	- What’s my diet if i’m half human half animal? Bugs. If God had wanted us to be concerned for the plight of bugs, he would have made them cute and furry.
	- I once knew a dragon man like me! He was so powerful and serious. Whenever I said he was like me, though, he would get angry and curse my bloodline. 
	- Why am I called a furlin? Well; I don’t know where I came from, but I met some piglins once, and found out we were similar species! But when I tried to get into their tribes, they’d always kick me out for being annoying. Don’t worry about me though, I know it’s their loss!

Human Shulker (end cities random top) - A shulker with a birth deformity that can talk; suspected to be a failed prototype for mutant shulker. 
	- Bbbreeet. (Waiting for something to happen.)
	- Breeaugh. (Why, my legs are just a birth deformity, that’s why they’re there. No other reason)
	- Brrrep. (It’s lonely being an outcast to the most lonely species in the most lonely dimension)
	- Bbrrr. (I tried levitating another shulker once, he mutated and became a giant monster)
	- Brruhhhh(*grows a third leg*)

Mad Scientist(Dr Zomboss)(plague asylum)-
	- Why hello there, fresh meat! 
	- The only way to beat me is to outcrazy my craziness. And I’ve only met one person crazier than me. 
	- Don’t worry, I am too sophisticated to eat your smooth brain. 
	- It’s so cliché and basic to be sentient to be mortal these days. My degree in thanatology tells me you’d be better off dead. No, no, that’s a compliment! 
	- I swear, my work would be flawless if it wasn’t for those meddling plants. 

Short Man(Spawns in Hobbit Den, is straight up frodo baggins)-
	- In a hole in the ground, there lived a short man. That’s me!
	- Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be a good one?
	- Do you know of any live dragons in this realm? Hey, don’t laugh at the idea. 
	- I miss my friend, the wizard. Last I saw him he was stuck up his tower, looked frail, like he skipped second breakfast. I heard men grunting and shouting inside, must’ve been a late party. 
	- Goblins here throw a ruckus!  I wish they were half as mature as elves. 
	
Enderling Traveler(Spawns in villages post dragon)
	- Hi! Now that the portal’s opened, however unfortunate the reasons, I decided to make myself at home. 
	- Big kudos for what ya did back there. That ender dragon lady’s been terrorizing us for decades. Sorry we couldn’t tell ya in time. 
	- Previously only enderman could teleport between dimensions and only temporarily. With the portal finally opened, all sorts of connections to the end are bound to be made again. 
	- The End is a pretty nice place, but god is here so much better. 
	- Well, technically I'm an Enderling, like Blastling and Watchling. And I'm not a man either; so I don't really know that much about endermen to be honest. Wait, is there an enderwoman? How do they breed? Or was that the drag- oh, oh no.
