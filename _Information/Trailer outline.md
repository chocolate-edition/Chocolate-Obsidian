Title: I Remade Minecraft - Chocolate Edition Official Trailer (2023) 

1. Opens with a bunch of shots of calming music and clips of wildlife in different biomes each lasting a second or less 

2. Last clip is of two players playing together until they hear something and turn around. Music stops. It is a loud rumbling noise in the distance and it is shown ravaging the land. Cut to black for a second 

3. Cuts to a villager walking in a dimly lit hallway in a dark nether dungeon. He is holding an eye of ender. When he gets to the table hears a illager noise, and when he looks up, its an illager, the one he should hate the most. But they are working together. Beside him are a piglin and enderman. Cuts back to villager and he looks down at the eye and says “hurr.”and puts it on the table. The eye shivers and breaks, and the screen fades to white.  

4. Combat music starts. Clips of various quick combat scenes in structures and the general world are shown from all across the modpack. The music rises and when it hits its peak, becomes adventurous.  

5. Cuts to clips of exploring jaw dropping landscapes, cooking, fishing, crafting, building, interacting with npcs, Getting ready for what’s to come. The adventurous music slows a bit until the player goes to open a door, for a split second he hesitates, but then flashes back to some lore. He opens and it cuts to black.  

6. We return to the scene with the villager. No one is harmed, but all the various mobs at the table(we now get a better shot of the sheer variety, there's a lot; i intend on having spiderverse levels of cool background characters) are staring in awe. On the table is the first eye. It is teeming with sheer power. They all start cheering with their minecraft noises as the camera pans out to show thousands of mobs of all races gathered around the table which is shown to be heightened above them in the middle. Lasts for a few sec until we cut back to the table and hear a bang of a pickaxe. Camera shows everyone’s reactions until we look at the table. Shot shows pulling out a sword, that points at the eye. The camera slowly pans up to reveal a player; the player, the player who's fought the ender dragon thousands of times over the course of Minecraft's lifespan. Music gets courageous, cuts to black and stops briefly.  

7. Cut to boss fights. That's it just a long montage of boss fights synced to the best part of the music. At the end i plan on having a strong boss that you slice into as the screen turns white except for your and the bosses black silhouettes. Music comes to a climax. Cuts to black for a few seconds.  

8. A loud, deep growl fills the room. In a dank, dark cave we see only silhouettes of the room. Slowly reveals a enderman looking up at the camera. A wet, loud roar pierces the endermen ears and forces him to stand back and teleport before he falls. Cut to a slow shot revealing the wither storm head rising for a split second. Music swells for the last time. End trailer
